## FLIXBUDDIES

Users of FLIXBUDDIES cannot only learn which movies and shows are currently trending and create a watchlist and a list of favorites, but also share them with friends. For this, movie data is fetched from an external API. The Watchlist, the Favorites and user data is stored and fetched (to render friends) using an own backend. In order to hide the API key – issued by the movie database – in network traffic, the backend also serves as a middleware to handle the get requests. The app is a digital journeyman's piece and marks the successful completion of my 3 month coding bootcamp at neue fische, upon which I became a certified Junior Web Developer. The functionalities used in this app represent my coding skills of April 2021. Many thanks to neue fische for giving me the opportunity to attend their bootcamp and a huge shoutout to my incredibly gifted (and patient) coaches Miriam and Thomas.
